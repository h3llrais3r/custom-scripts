- copy udev rules for mounting external disks:
	- format usb stick as fat32
	- name it CONFIG
	- create folder udev
	- put 80-mount-usb-to-media-by-label.rules inside folder
	- connect to HA
	- reboot
	- go to http://hass.local/hassio/system/
	- select on host tab: import from usb
	- check if host logs if configuration is updated
	- disconnect usb stick
	- connect usb which we want to mount (ATTENTION: must be ext4!)
	- usb is mounted with name of usb partition (f.e. frigate)
