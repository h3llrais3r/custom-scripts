IP6Tunnel tunnel (and disable Teredo tunnel)
--------------------------------------------

Disable teredo tunnel:
----------------------
netsh interface teredo set state disabled

Create IP6Tunnel tunnel:
------------------------
netsh interface ipv6 add v6v4tunnel interface=IP6Tunnel localaddress=<ipv4_client> remoteaddress=<ipv4_server>
netsh interface ipv6 add address interface=IP6Tunnel address=<ipv6_client>
netsh interface ipv6 add route prefix=::/0 interface=IP6Tunnel nexthop=<ipv6_server>

Delete IP6Tunnel tunnel:
------------------------
netsh interface ipv6 delete route ::/0 IP6Tunnel
netsh interface ipv6 delete address IP6Tunnel <ipv6_client>
netsh interface ipv6 delete interface IP6Tunnel

-> delete address and route is not needed, it's done automatically when deleting the interface!
